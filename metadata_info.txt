The metadata file can contain any kind of numeric data in the following format:
- Tab delimited text file
- First row are headers (the options that will appear in the drop-down menu)
- First column are sites/paths names (paths/elments in the svg image)
- The rest should be valid numeric values

Notes:
- It accepts empty spaces that will be considered as NaNs and not used to color
- Every line that starts either with "#", "%", "eigenval" (without ") will be consider comments
